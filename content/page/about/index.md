Hello there, welcome to my small part of the internet where in theory I should be writing about things I enjoy.
Professionally, I work at [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/) where I work on their cloud platform.
I play music as well, mostly bass guitar now a days.

At Grafana Labs, I'm currently working on [Synthetic Monitoring](https://grafana.com/products/cloud/synthetic-monitoring/).
Before that, I worked on the platform team building out tooling for cost management.
