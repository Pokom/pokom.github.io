# Faro

> I'm writing this in my personal time as I explore Faro and see how I can use it with hugo.

I want to monitor traffic to this site, but to do it in a way that has some semblance of privacy.
In the past I've used Google Analytics, but feel this pulls much more data then I'm comfortable with.
It's a powerful tool that I've used personally and professionaly, but for the most part I do not need most of the features.
I want to be able to know the following

- How many users visited my website, broken down by page
- How long does a user stay?
- How much data is transmitted?
- How well does the page perform?

[Grafana Faro](https://grafana.com/oss/faro/) appears to be able to do all of these things.

1. What is Grafana Faro
2. How do I add it to a hugo site?
3. Should this be contributed back?
4. Now that it's instrumented, what can I do with it?

## How do I add Grafana Faro to a Hugo site

Main docs:
https://grafana.com/docs/grafana-cloud/monitor-applications/frontend-observability/instrument/faro/

This seems pretty straight forward.
The steps are

1. create an app in grafana cloud
2. inject the faro sdk into the web app via
   1. importing NodeJS module
   2. downloading via CDN directly

I think for Hugo, CDN makes the most sense. The pertinent code that needs to be invoked is:

```HTML
<script>
  (function () {
    // Create a script tag for loading the library
    var script = document.createElement("script");

    // Initialize the Web SDK at the onLoad event of the script element so it is called when the library is loaded.
    script.onload = () => {
      window.GrafanaFaroWebSdk.initializeFaro({
        // Mandatory, the URL of the Grafana Cloud collector with embedded application key.
        // Copy from the configuration page of your application in Grafana.
        url: "http://faro-collector-us-central-0.grafana.net/collect/{app-key}",

        // Mandatory, the identification label(s) of your application
        app: {
          name: "my-app",
          version: "1.0.0", // Optional, but recommended
        },
      });
    };

    // Set the source of the script tag to the CDN
    script.src =
      "https://unpkg.com/@grafana/faro-web-sdk@^1.0.0-beta/dist/bundle/faro-web-sdk.iife.js";

    // Append the script tag to the head of the HTML document
    document.head.appendChild(script);
  })();
</script>
```

Question is how can you add this to a website generated by Hugo?
Hugo supports the ability to edit themes by copying the `${theme_sub_directory}/theme/partials` to your local `/theme/partials` folder.
You can edit the `header.html` partial after copying the themes partials over and append the script from above.

**Note**: Applications created in Grafana Cloud have a better script

After adding the Faro script to the header, deploy your changes and you should start collecting sessions.
