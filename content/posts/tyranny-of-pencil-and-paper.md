Windsurfer being aqcuired by ~OpenAI~ Cognition is making me reconsider the way I work.
I have been skeptical that LLM's will be the next major revolution in technology.
Experience has provided enough context to have heard many other technologies claim they'll usher in a new era of tech.
There's still this small pit of fear that I am wrong on this and miss out on a potentially career ending mistake.

## Early Days of LLM's

I started using GitHub Copilot just about when it GA'ed in mid 2022.
My daughter was 6 months old and so it's safe to say I wasn't getting much sleep.
Lack of sleep doesn't line up well with knowledge work and I was curious to see what these tools could do to help.
I had a few little toy projects in mind that I figured, let's see how Copilot copes.

Most of my usage was to assist me when I got stuck working on some side projects.
My primary function at work at the time was a DevOps/SRE/Platform/Whatever the buzz word is today, and so I wasn't writing as much code as I had before.
Between lack of sleep and lack of daily coding, copilot was perfect for when I got stuck.
It felt like StackOverflow answers were just a few key strokes away, without having to open up a browser.

I built a few tools at the time that were useful but never got out in the open.
My main goal ways to refresh my software development skills and pivot back into that space.
Think ~1000-2000 LoC applications that made my life slightly easier, like:
- scraped a website and tracked ratings to help demonstrate a bot was responsible for tanking ratings.
- wallpaper manager that hooked into Muzei's API.
- scraper to detect when the special baby formula was available and send an alert(raising a child during the pandemic was fun)

## What made me skeptic

I strongly believe that mastering any subject means commiting countless hours of work through progressively harder problems.
Often this means failing repeatedly until whatever concept sticks.
When using Copilot, I was able to solve the problems I set out to do.
Despite this, I couldn't help but feel like I did not fully retain the knowledge.
Key concepts never quite stuck, and I often found myself becoming dependent on the LLM to produce code.
Jumping back into the codebases after some time away left me feeling completely lost.
It was frustrating to invest the extra time into improving my skills and not feel the growth.

I came to believe that LLM's were useful, but are not a replacement for learning fundamentals.
Your productivity should increase as you become more proficient with a new technology.
What I found was I stayed stuck as an advanced beginner, and never had a path out of it.
This has happened to me before, and so I forced myself to go back to being a beginner and work my way out of it the way I always did: pen and paper

> Note: This type of argument has been made for the progress of many technological advancements.

## Thinking in pen and paper

My best way of learning is still by writing things out with pen and paper.
Just like StackOverflow did not replace that, LLM's won't either.
LLM's that provide autocomplete functionality are at best nondeterministic type aheads.
They are meant to _wow_ you and make you feel like you are a wizard.
But without deep understanding, it's purely a magic tragic. 
If I abandon my pursuit of learning and give in fully to my LLM overlords, then I am tying my future to nondeterministic systems that have no ounce of passion for my craft.

With all of that, how do I balance staying current in world that supposedly changes radically with each new model released?
I suppose I could look back to the advice I was given with StackOverflow:
- Use it to get unstock, 
- Do not copy and paste answers verbatim
- Explain back concepts using factual sources

These tools are a means to an end. 
How you use them is entirely up to you.
My choice is to still use them with caution and only when necessary.
Agentic LLM's may change my opinion, but for right now, I'll stay cautious.
