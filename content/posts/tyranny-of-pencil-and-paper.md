The recent news of Windsurfer being aqcuired by ~OpenAI~ Cognition really got me thinking about the way I work.
Well, that's not entirely true, because I've been thinking about the way I work since ChatGPT was released to the wild.
I was(and still am) skeptical that this is the next major revolution in technology, but the impact on my personal ability to write and maintain software is clear.
From the early days of ChatGPT and Copilot, I've turned to these tools when I was stuck on problems.
The tools have either provided a path to getting unblocked _or_ got me so frustrated that I decided I was taking the wrong path.
End result was making progress on whatever I was working on.
So much effort is being put into how these tools are redefining the workforce and productivity.
But my day to day still appears to be very similar to how it was before, I just have another tool to use.
I still spend a good amount of my time thinking slowly and deliberately with pencil and paper.
My anxiety is creeping in though and I'm wondering if my habits of thinking on paper is going to hold me back?

## School Years

I was born in an interesting era.
Most of my work in elementary school was primarily on paper, transition to typing in middle school.
Highschool was a mixture of both, but all of my essays were written on a computer and printed out to submit.
Google and Wikipedia were established by time I was tasked with writing essays that required research.
Neither of which were valid references, but you can be sure that I used them anyway and learned to check references.
The thing is though, I learned the way I learned best was still on paper.
After getting my thoughts composed on paper, I would then commit them by typing them out.
So the best essays I wrote were the ones where I basically knew exactly what I wanted to communicate.

Studying computer science in college was very similar experience.
Lab assignments were usually uploaded to a website for the teacher to review.
Exams were almost always writting out by hand.
My best work for labs was almost always when I could write out the assigment by hand.

## Professional life

My career could probably best be described as bumpy.
I've found I performed my best when I have

- Had consistent access to white boards
- Took most notes by hand
- Thought out in written form

This contrasts with the intense pressure that I'm feeling with the advent of agentic LLM's.
If my best thought is done in written form, how do I interact with this new world?
Is there a path for me to take that allows me to think in written form, but better interact with LLMs?
