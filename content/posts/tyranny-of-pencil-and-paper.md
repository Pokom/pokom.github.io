Windsurfer being aqcuired by ~OpenAI~ Cognition is making me reconsider the way I work.
I have been skeptical that LLM's will be the next major revolution in technology.
Experience has provided enough context to know that this isn't the first technology that claims to change the world.
But like any tool, I prefer to be curious to before forming a strong opinion.

## Early days

GitHub Copilot was made generally available in June 2022 and I used it for the first time shortly after.
One of my favorite moments was forgetting to disable Copilot during an interview at Grafana Labs.
Part of Grafana Labs interview process is being tasked with solving a small coding challenge based upon a problem in an actual product.
You pair up with 2 other engineers and get to work in whatever language and environment you feel comfortable in.
After reviewing the README and tests, I moved on to implementing the main bits of code.
Copilot autosuggested something that looked very similar to what I had in mind.
The interviewers were suprised as they had not seen Copilot before, so I disabled it.
Despite this early success, I still found it challenging to integrate in my day to day.

## Thinking in pen and paper

I mainly used LLM's on my personal projects.
These were things that I would work on sporadically.
When I work sporadically, I find it challenging to pick things back up after some time.
The elure with LLM's is you can offload the context into an LLM and let it pick things back up for you.
This is fine for things that I work on every few months.
My fear with becoming reliant on an LLM is that I would not absord important bits of context.

## School Years

I was born in an interesting era.
Most of my work in elementary school was primarily on paper, transition to typing in middle school.
Highschool was a mixture of both, but all of my essays were written on a computer and printed out to submit.
Google and Wikipedia were established by time I was tasked with writing essays that required research.
Neither of which were valid references, but you can be sure that I used them anyway and learned to check references.
The thing is though, I learned the way I learned best was still on paper.
After getting my thoughts composed on paper, I would then commit them by typing them out.
So the best essays I wrote were the ones where I basically knew exactly what I wanted to communicate.

Studying computer science in college was very similar experience.
Lab assignments were usually uploaded to a website for the teacher to review.
Exams were almost always writting out by hand.
My best work for labs was almost always when I could write out the assigment by hand.

## Professional life

I've found I performed my best when I have

- Had consistent access to white boards
- Took most notes by hand
- Thought out in written form

This contrasts with the intense pressure that I'm feeling with the advent of agentic LLM's.
If my best thought is done in written form, how do I interact with this new world?
Is there a path for me to take that allows me to think in written form, but better interact with LLMs?
