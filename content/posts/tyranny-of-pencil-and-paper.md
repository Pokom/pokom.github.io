Windsurfer being aqcuired by ~OpenAI~ Cognition is making me reconsider the way I work.
I have been skeptical that LLM's will be the next major revolution in technology.
Experience has provided enough context to know that this isn't the first technology that claims to change the world.
There's still this small pit of fear that I am wrong on this and miss out on a potentially career ending mistake.

## Early Days of LLM's

I started using GitHub Copilot just about when it GA'ed in mid 2022.
My daughter was roughly 6 months old  and so it's safe to say I wasn't getting much sleep.
Lack of sleep doesn't line up well with knowledge work, so I was curious to see what these tools could do to help.

Most of my usage was to assist me when I got stuck working on some side projects.
I found it most valuable when I used it when getting stuck.
It felt like StackOverflow answers were just a few key strokes away, without having to open up a browser.
When you're short on sleep, starting with something broken was much easier then a blank editor.

## What made me skeptic

I built a few tools at the time that were useful but never got out in the open.
These tools were ways to refresh my Software development skills after spending a few years as a DevOps engineer.
Think ~1000-2000 LoC applications that made my life slightly easier, like:
- scraped a website and tracked ratings to help demonstrate a bot was responsible for tanking ratings.
- wallpaper manager that hooked into Muzei's API.
- scraper to detect when the special baby formula was available and send an alert(raising a child during the pandemic was fun)


Despite this, I couldn't help but feel like I did not fully retain the knowledge.
Key concepts never quite stuck, and I often found myself becoming dependent on the LLM to produce code.
It was frustrating to invest the extra time into improving my skills and not feel the growth.

I strongly believe that mastering any subject means commiting thousands of hours working through progressively harder problems.
Often this means failing repeatedly until whatever concept sticks.

I came to believe that LLM's were useful, but are not a replacement for learning fundamentals.
Your productivity should increase as you become more proficient with a new technology.
What I found was I stayed stuck as an advanced beginner, and never had a path out of it.
This has happened to me before, and so I forced myself to go back to being a beginner and work my way out of it the way I always did: pen and paper

> Note: This type of argument has been made for the progress of many technological advancements.

## Thinking in pen and paper

Despite every tool imagineable being built for computers, I still come back to thinking in pen and paper.
I've found that I learn best when I commit something in writing.
I have a 12x18 sketch journal that I try and fill a page for whatever it is that I'm learning or working on.
There is no intention of this being a source of truth, it's meant mostly as a scratch pad.
