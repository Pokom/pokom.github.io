&nbsp; · &nbsp;3 min read</p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><p>I had a laptop refresh at work and decided to try running <a href=https://archlinux.org/>Arch Linux</a> for the first time.
I&rsquo;ve used Ubuntu for workstations at a few other jobs, but not all of the places I worked supported this.
The challenge I had for myself was to get a basic setup within a weeks time and then decide if I wanted to switch back to Ubuntu.
A week turned into a month, but here&rsquo;s some of my experiences.</p><h2 class=heading id=initial-impressions>Initial Impressions
<a class=anchor href=#initial-impressions>#</a></h2><p>Arch has a reputation as being a challening linux distro to get up and running.
I&rsquo;m no stranger to running linux, but I would in no way consider myself an expert.
So I was expecting my learning curve to be a bit steeper as most things worked (with a bit of effort) out of the box.
With a little bit of effort largely meant reading through the <a href=https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide>installation guide</a> and tweaking things to get it to work.</p><h3 class=heading id=first-boot>First boot
<a class=anchor href=#first-boot>#</a></h3><p>What was fun about Arch is that the install gives you a kernel and <em>very</em> little else.
During installation you can install packages, useful ones being <code>networkmanager|(n)vim|sway|firefox</code>, however there&rsquo;s no recommendation on what do to.
After that you&rsquo;re dropped into a tty screen and if you (hopefully) setup an admin password(<code>passwd</code>) or regular user, you can login.
Otherwise, it&rsquo;s back to the boot media to create those users.
Once you&rsquo;re logged in, you&rsquo;re basically given what I would consider a server.</p><p>At this point, I think it&rsquo;s totally fair to wonder why you wouldn&rsquo;t just install Ubuntu or Debian.
You&rsquo;d likely already have a working machine with all of your tools setup.</p><p>Without installing extra packages, the following things do not work:</p><ul><li>display manager</li><li>networking</li><li>bluetooth</li><li>audio</li><li>laptop clamshell functionality</li><li>basic keyboard shortcuts like volume up/down</li><li>network discovery for things like printers</li></ul><p>Despite all of this, what I found most enjoyable was going through each of those components and learning a little bit deeper about how they work.</p><h2 class=heading id=tools-learned>Tools learned
<a class=anchor href=#tools-learned>#</a></h2><p>Here&rsquo;s a bit of what I learned in the first week.</p><ul><li>accessing wifi without a gui(<code>nmcli</code>, <code>networkmanager</code>)</li><li>setting up disk from scratch(<code>lsblk</code>, <code>fdisk</code>, <code>cfisdk</code>)</li><li>encrypting full disks(<code>dm-crypt</code>, <code>luks</code>, <code>lvm</code>, <code>(pv|vg|lv)create</code>, <code>cryptsetup</code>)</li><li>filesystems(<code>mkfs.$</code>, <code>mount</code>)</li><li>bootloaders(<code>grub</code>)</li><li>audio/video(<code>pactl</code>, <code>pipewire</code>)</li><li>bluetooth(<code>bluez</code>)</li></ul><h2 class=heading id=biggest-surprise>Biggest Surprise
<a class=anchor href=#biggest-surprise>#</a></h2><p>Arch has a well earned reputation for it&rsquo;s learning curve.
If you&rsquo;ve used any Linux system before, then there&rsquo;s a good chance you could piece things together.
But what suprised me is how reasonable it was to get to a decent spot.
Arch has is one of the better curated wiki&rsquo;s with documentation for almost any problem you have.
If that doesn&rsquo;t work, they have a fairly active forum(though this is daunting).
I used tools that I normally wouldn&rsquo;t have considered(<code>strace</code>) to debug problems I was having.
Every now and then I find setting things up easier on Arch then on Ubuntu(<code>obs</code> + <code>scarlett focusrite</code>).</p><h2 class=heading id=sharp-edges>Sharp Edges
<a class=anchor href=#sharp-edges>#</a></h2><p>One of the more sharp edges that I&rsquo;m having is around Sway + Wayland.
A considerable amount of Gui&rsquo;s are built with some form of <a href=https://www.qt.io/product/framework>QT</a>.
So for some reason, when I launch some GUI based applications, I run into some weird states.
Chromium + Signal I need to launch with a special flag.
I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a good reason for it, but to me it&rsquo;s a bit magical.</p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/posts/grpc/>gRPC</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p>Powered by
